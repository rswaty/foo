This web report was developed by Liv, Nick, Silas and Randy of the [Conservation Data Lab](https://conservationdatalab.org/) and [Northern Michigan University](https://nmu.edu/) with the following goals:

* Support planning efforts by the [Marquette County Planning, Community Development, Forestry and Recreation Division](https://www.co.marquette.mi.us/departments/planning/index.php) 
* Practice GitHub, R, QGIS and ArcGIS Pro techniques
* Contribute to conservation in the central Upper Peninsula in general.

## Acknowledgements

We'd like to first acknowledge Robert Zeil (aka 'Zeke') who introduced us to, and taught Silas how to implement the Wildfire Exposure Risk calculations.

We'd like to also thank Sven Gonstead and Emily Leach of Marquette County for the inspiration, opportunity and for meeting with us!

And importantly, Dr. Matt Van Grinsven of NMU for moral, technical and space support!

Liv is originally from the Grand Rapids area of Michigan, and had the privilege of growing up exploring the forests, lakes, and wetlands of the Lower Peninsula. She is a recent graduate from Northern Michigan University (NMU) with a B.S. in Environmental Science (natural resources emphasis) and a minor in Native American Studies. She has worked with Superior Watershed Partnership in the Great Lakes Climate Corps (GLCC) alongside US Forest Service and Keweenaw Bay Indian Community Natural Resources Department partners for the past two summers. Her studies at NMU and conservation work with GLCC deepened her passion for working outdoors and learning more about the natural world. In the off season, Liv works as a ski instructor, specializing in teaching children. She is looking forward to continuing conservation work in a position with the US Forest Service as a Hydrology Technician in Canjilon, New Mexico.
